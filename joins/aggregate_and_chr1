SELECT

I ran this:
SELECT 
  genedefs.gene_id as group_id,  
  genedefs.chr as chromosome,  
  chr1.`[2]POS` as position, 
  chr1.`[3]REF` as ref, 
  chr1.`[4]ALT` as alt 
FROM 
  genedefs 
JOIN 
  chr1 ON genedefs.chr = chr1.`# [1]CHROM` 
AND 
  chr1.`[2]POS` BETWEEN genedefs.agg_start AND genedefs.agg_end 
WHERE 
  genedefs.chr = 1
